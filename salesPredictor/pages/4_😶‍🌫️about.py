st.write('Keeping track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand, adjust inventory management and the popularity of that given product in a region to adjust shipping quotas has become a very important aspect of automating demand for big supermarkets, where the amount of iteams and goods processed are very high. The sales and other associated data for this purpose are collected from various sources and stored in data warehouses across the country to optimize for analytics purposes. By carefully mining and processing this data, interesting visualization, various anomalies and many interesting patterns can be found. This data is finally used to optimize profit and loss for the respective retailer.')
